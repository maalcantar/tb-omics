!Series_summary	"Identification of blood biomarkers that prospectively predict progression of Mycobacterium tuberculosis  infection to tuberculosis disease might lead to interventions that combat the tuberculosis epidemic in the context of house hold contacts."
!Series_overall_design	"Samples are collected from subjects in a household contact study after a person comes back to the household, diagnosed with TB. Samples are collected every 6 months upto, 18 months. Some people go on to develop TB (cases)  where as some others do not (controls). Here we are trying to establish a gene signature to predict the occurance of TB."
!Series_type	"Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing"
